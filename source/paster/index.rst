################################

* minitage relies activelly on paster templates to quickstart rapidly a new project or a new application instance on an environement(/and project).

* As we were very happy with thoses templates, we choosed to make them available even if you are not inside a minitage environment.
  Despite, it will lack the minitage integration of getting dependencies in the environement, you will have the possibility to
  generate the needed template, somewhere.

* There are many kind of templates you can use right now, and an infinty of possibilities to extend them.
  Just take your time to appreciate the next sections which will present you in details the available templates.
