What is minitage
#######################################

Is minitage for me : **Yes, it makes no doubt.**

Is it free: It is completly free (``GPL2``)!

Minitage spirit
-------------------
- Minitage is a meta packages manager:

    * It's goal is to integrate build systems / other package manager together to make them install in a **well known layout**.
    * It isolates your project & dependencies as much as possible from the host system
    * This makes deployments easy, even if the first one can be tedious to assemble, idea is focused on the automation & reproducibility.
    * This enables you to have industrialized & reproducible environments
    * This will **save** developers **from manual** compilation and configuration steps from sysadmin world
    * This will save admins from crazy developers stuff
    * This can even deploy your software **totally offline**

If you have some doubts about them, feel free to inform us on the bug tracker :)

A professional tool
----------------------
It s a collection of tools used by professionals which tends to be well documented and tested.

Pre requisite knowledge
-------------------------

 - Read carefully this documentation: http://plone.org/documentation/tutorial/buildout.
 - And this one can be good too: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout
 - It is essential for you to know the basics of buildout to use it.
 - It is not necessary for you to test it because you will do the practise part just after ;).
