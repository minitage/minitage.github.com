Minitage and paster templates
*****************************

* minitage relies activelly on paster templates to quickstart rapidly
  a new project or a new application instance on an environement(/and
  project).

* As we were very happy with thoses templates, we choosed to make them
  available even if you are not inside a minitage environment.
  Despite, it will lack the minitage integration of getting
  dependencies in the environement, you will have the possibility to
  generate the needed template, somewhere.

* There are many kind of templates you can use right now, and an
  infinty of possibilities to extend them. Just take your time to
  appreciate the next sections which will present you in details the
  available templates.
