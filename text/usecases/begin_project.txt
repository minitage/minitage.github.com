Beginning a project with minitage: The Initial Steps
****************************************************


Project initialization
======================

* Choose an existing  *minitage layout* if any suits your needs.

* Create the project itself and package it to be 'minitage compliant'
  (uploading, versionining). To quickstart, just just an existing
  minitage template.

* Create or edit a minibuild, in a minilays  which points to this
  layout:

     mkdir -p $mt/minilays/mynewminilay
     vim  $mt/minilays/mynewminilay/project

* Maybe, it is a good time to version the minilay.

* Lets go for the minimerge dance:

     minimerge myproject


Project versionning
===================

* Play around and when your are ready, just version in this way:

     * $mt/category/project      ->
       http://url/buildouts/$category/myproject

     * $mt/minilays/yourproject  -> http://url/minilays/myproject

* Don't forget to adapt the *src_uri* or your minibuild:

     [minibuild]
     ...
     src_uri=http://url/buildouts/$category/myproject
     ...
